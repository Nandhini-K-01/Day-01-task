2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript

Answer:

OBJECTS:

Objects, in javaScript, is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. It is used because it is easy representation and accessibility.
They are simply a collection of key:value pairs.


WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS:

1. By object literal
2. By creating instance of object directly (using new keyword)


BY OBJECT LITERAL:

syntax: var objectname = {key1:value1 , key2:value2, ..... ,keyn:valuen}
example: var person = {name:"john", age:20, email:"xyz@gmail.com"}


BY USING NEW KEYWORD:

syntax: var objectname = new Object();
example: var a = new Car()
         a.santro = "blue"
         a.BMW = "red"


ACCESSING JS OBJECTS:

Syntax: objectName.keyname (dot operator method)

              or

        objectName[“key”]


Accessing age from object literal example using dot operator,
            person.age       


Accessing ‘blue’ from new keyword example using [],
           a["santro"]


=> We can use for...in loop to iterate over all the keys of an object.
