1. Write a blog on difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:

HTTP1.1:

* It was introduced in 1997.

* It works on the textual format.

* In HTTP1.1, flow control relies on the underlying TCP connection.

* It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.

* It compresses data by itself.

* Syntax and semantics are separated.


HTTP2:

* It was introduced in 2015.

* It works on the binary protocol.

* HTTP2 multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP connection. 

* It sends multiple streams of data at once, no one resource blocks any other resource (because of single TCP connection).

* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.

* It uses HPACK for data compression. 

* Addition of priortization function in units of stream.
